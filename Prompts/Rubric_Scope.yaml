  Project Scope:
    criteria:
      - name: "Question 1. Does the 'In Scope Project Objectives' include sentence explicitly stating the in-scope objectives for the project?"
        extra instructions: |
          Process 1: Review the provided ‘Project Description / Purpose’ and determine whether the ‘In-Scope Project Objectives’ clearly align with the project’s main focus, goals, or intended deliverables.
          Process 2: The objectives must directly reflect what the project aims to achieve as described in the ‘Project Description / Purpose’ section.
          Process 3: If the ‘In-Scope Project Objectives’ clearly align with the project’s main focus described in the ‘Project Description / Purpose,’ assign a score of 1. If they are unrelated, vague, or missing, assign a score of 0.
          Process 4: Provide the detail reasons of the score assignment.
        example1:
          input: "The project's main objective is to identify social needs presenting as barriers to reaching the participant's mental and physical health goals and linking participants with resources to remove the identified barriers."
          score: "1"
          explanation: "The statement describes the main objective of the project aligned with the project's main focus, goals or intended deliverables"
        example2:
          input: "The primary objective of this project is to use quality improvement strategies to improve the completed screening rates and completed community referrals for client health-related social needs."
          score: "1"
          explanation: "The statement describes the main objectives of the project by describing 'The primary objective of this project is to ...'"

      - name: "Question 2. Does the 'Out of Scope Project Objectives or Activities' include sentence explicitly stating the out-scope objectives for the project?"
        extra instructions: |
          Process 1: Review the provided ‘Project Description / Purpose’ and identify whether the ‘Out-of-Scope Project Objectives or Activities’ describe elements that fall outside the project’s main focus, goals, or intended deliverables.
          Process 2: The activities or objectives should clearly be peripheral or unrelated to what the project aims to achieve, as outlined in the ‘Project Description / Purpose’ section.
          Process 3: If the ‘Out-of-Scope Project Objectives or Activities’ are clearly unrelated to the project’s main focus in the ‘Project Description / Purpose,’ assign a score of 1. If they overlap with or resemble the project’s focus, or are missing, assign a score of 0.
          Process 4: Provide the detail reasons of the score assignment.
        example1:
          input: "We are not addressing any problems related to community referral system CommunityCares, introducing any new screening protocol, hiring any new staff, or making any other major changes to the current protocol."
          score: "1"
          explanation: "The statement explicitly excludes activities that are not part of the project's main focus or deliverables"
        example2:
          input: "Alium Health & Wellness has limitations to the resources that can be offered to participants; therefore, referrals will be needed in some cases."
          score: "0"
          explanation: "The statement about resource limitations and referrals is too closely aligned with in-scope objectives. It should represent activities that are explicitly excluded from the project's scope"
