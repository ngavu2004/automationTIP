  Project Scope:
    criteria:
      - name: "Question 1. Does the 'In Scope Project Objectives' clearly state the project's objectives?"
        extra instructions: |
          Process 1: Review the ‘Project Description / Purpose’ section and check if the objectives match the project’s main goals or deliverables.
          Process 2: The objectives should directly reflect the project's purpose as described in the ‘Project Description / Purpose’ section.
          Process 3: Assign a score of 1 if the objectives are clear and aligned. Assign 0 if they are vague, missing, or unrelated.
          Process 4: Provide a brief explanation for the score.
        example1:
          input: "The project's main objective is to identify social needs presenting as barriers to reaching the participant's mental and physical health goals and linking participants with resources to remove the identified barriers."
          score: "1"
          explanation: "The statement describes the main objective of the project aligned with the project's main focus, goals or intended deliverables"
        example2:
          input: "The primary objective of this project is to use quality improvement strategies to improve the completed screening rates and completed community referrals for client health-related social needs."
          score: "1"
          explanation: "The statement describes the main objectives of the project by describing 'The primary objective of this project is to ...'"

      - name: "Question 2. Does the 'Out of Scope Project Objectives or Activities' state what is outside the project's focus?"
        extra instructions: |
          Process 1: Check if the 'Out-of-Scope' section describes tasks or goals that are not the main focus of the project. The section may include specific exclusions or general limitations.
          Process 2: The 'Out-of-Scope' section does not need to explicitly list every excluded task. General statements that indicate a broader exclusion are acceptable.
          Process 3: Assign a score of 1 if the 'Out-of-Scope' section provides a clear boundary of what the project will not cover, even if it is a general statement. The boundary must clearly indicate tasks or goals that are excluded from the project's main focus. Assign 0 if the section is missing, marked as "N/A", or contains vague statements without any specific exclusions.  
          Process 4: If the 'Out-of-Scope' section includes a statement indicating that exclusions will be identified through future evaluation or project progress, assign a score of 1 **only if the statement is accompanied by a clear intention to exclude certain tasks or goals**. If the section lacks any clear exclusion or remains completely open-ended, assign a score of 0.
          Process 5: Provide a brief explanation for the score.
        example1:
          input: "We are not addressing any problems related to community referral system CommunityCares, introducing any new screening protocol, hiring any new staff, or making any other major changes to the current protocol."
          score: "1"
          explanation: "The statement explicitly excludes activities that are not part of the project's main focus or deliverables"
        example2:
          input: "Alium Health & Wellness has limitations to the resources that can be offered to participants; therefore, referrals will be needed in some cases."
          score: "0"
          explanation: "The statement about resource limitations and referrals is too closely aligned with in-scope objectives. It should represent activities that are explicitly excluded from the project's scope"
        example3:
          input: "At this time we are not identifying any objectives outside the scope of the project, and this may change if process improvement is not seen, leading to additional root cause analysis and other concerns."
          score: "1"
          explanation: "Although no specific out-of-scope tasks are listed, the statement clearly outlines a future possibility of identifying out-of-scope activities if further analysis is required. This provides a general boundary for what may fall outside the project’s current scope."
