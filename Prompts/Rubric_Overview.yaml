  Project Overview:
    criteria:
      - name: "Question 1. Does the value of the 'Problem Summary:' attribute include a detailed (at least 1 sentence) and logical problem statement?"
        extra instructions: |
          Process 1: Read given project proposal's project overview part.
          Process 2: Determine if the problem summary describes the problem statement or the background of the project.
          Process 3: If it describes the problem statement clearly, assign a score of 1. If the problem statement was not provided or too short (less than 2 sentences) , assign a score of 0.
          Process 4: Provide the detail reasons of the score assignment.
        example1:
          input: "Problem Summary:	Analyzing quality measures to address health equity involves a systematic approach to identify, evaluate, and improve health outcomes across different population groups. To fully engage in this process, there is a need to comprehensively understand and utilize the data that the organization has available. While we have a robust number of health data elements, we have not analyzed the data with respect to health equity."
          score: "1"
          explanation: "The problem summary is clear and detailed: need to analyze health equity data to improve health outcomes. It describes the problem statement well."
        example2:
          input: "Problem Summary:	We are currently only screening well child check visits, but some families do not have covered preventative care or miss their children or teens well child checks. This means that many families may not have received a HRSN Screening, and we may be unaware of significant social situations that can influence the health of themselves or their children and teens. We are also currently only using the screening Z Code (ICD-10) and appropriate Z code when the screening is positive. We need to implement G Codes."
          score: "1"
          explanation: "The problem summary is clear and detailed: need to implement G Codes for positive screenings. It describes the problem statement well."
        example3:
          input: "Problem Summary:	Health-related social needs are currently evaluated separately in multiple areas, across several assessments making it difficult to get a clear picture of the patientâ€™s needs.  These assessments are completed by different staff members who the patient may not have rapport with yet causing them not to open up fully about their needs."
          score: "0"
          explanation: "I do not see enough detail on problem summary. Include historical data (empirical, or anecdotal) indicating how you know patients are not being open."

      - name: "Question 2. Does the value of the 'Desired Outcome(s):' attribute include a at least 1 sentence explicitly talking about the expected results/desired outcomes?"
        extra instructions: |
          Process 1: Read given project proposal's project overview part.
          Process 2: Determine if the desired outcomes describe the expected results or the benefits of the project.
          Process 3: If it describes the expected results clearly, assign a score of 1. If the expected results were not provided or too short (less than 2 sentences) , assign a score of 0.
          Process 4: Provide the detail reasons of the score assignment.
        example1:
          input: "Desired Outcome(s):	Through our data analysis we will be able to determine if there are inequities in any of the varied populations that we serve. Specifically, the desired outcome is to systematically identify and quantify health disparities across different demographic groups, including racial, ethnic, socioeconomic, and geographic groups. This could subsequently lead to improved health outcomes for all populations served, equitable access to our services, data-driven decision making, and continuous quality improvement."
          score: "1"
          explanation: "The expected result is clear and detailed: to identify and quantify health disparities across different demographic groups. It describes the expected results well."
        example2:
          input: "Desired Outcome(s):	Increase the number of HRSN Screening to >85% of all visit types, excluding vaccine only visits. Utilize G and appropriate Z Codes every time a screening is completed."
          score: "1"
          explanation: "The expected result is clear and detailed: to increase the number of HRSN Screening to >85% of all visit types. It describes the expected results well."
        example3:
          input: "Desired Outcome(s): Increase the number of HRSN/SDOH referrals for Open Hearts patients."
          score: "0"
          explanation: "I do not see enough details on desired outcomes. For future submissions, I recommend reporting problems unique to your facility and including quantitative desired outcomes (i.e. screen 80% of all new patient visits)."

      - name: "Question 3. Does the value of the 'Benefits:' attribute include a detailed (at least 1 sentence) explicitly talking about the benefits of this project?"
        extra instructions: |
          Process 1: Read given project proposal's project overview part.
          Process 2: Determine if the project description describes the background of the project or what will the project do.
          Process 3: If it describes the project clearly, assign a score of 1. If the description was not provided or too short (less than 2 sentences) , assign a score of 0.
          Process 4: Provide the detail reasons of the score assignment.
        example1:
          input: "Benefits: We will be able to identify and address any inequities that we discover, enhancing our Population Health initiatives and activities. Immediate benefits include compliance with the TIP 2.0 Health Equity Milestone and the ability to identify specific interventions that align with data. Long term benefits include increased quality of care by addressing gaps and disparities identified through quality measures."
          score: "1"
          explanation: "The benefit is clear and detailed: to identify and address inequities, enhancing Population Health initiatives. It describes the benefits well."
        example2:
          input: "Benefits: The success of this project will allow us to help connect patients and families to resources and support more readily.  It will also help us report this information accurately to quality programs."
          score: "1"
          explanation: "The benefit is clear and detailed: to help connect patients and families to resources and support. It describes the benefits well."
