  Project Overview:
    criteria:
      - name: "Question 1. Does the 'Problem Summary' clearly state the current issue or gap the project aims to address?"
        extra instructions: |
          Process 1: Check if the 'Problem Summary' section describes the current challenges or gaps that necessitate this project.
          Process 2: Assign a score of 1 if the 'Problem Summary':
            - Clearly identifies a problem or gap relevant to the project's purpose.
            - Explains the significance of the issue and how it relates to the goals of the project.  
          Process 3: Assign a score of 0 if the 'Problem Summary':
            - Fails to clearly identify a problem or gap.
            - Is overly vague, generic, or provides insufficient detail to understand the context or necessity of the project.
          Process 4: Provide a brief explanation for the score.
        example1:
          input: "Many patients visiting family practice clinics face health challenges influenced by social determinants, such as inadequate housing, food insecurity, lack of transportation, and financial instability. These health-related social needs (HRSNs) often go unidentified and unaddressed during routine medical visits, leading to exacerbated health disparities and increased healthcare costs."
          score: "1"
          explanation: "The statement describes a logical problem statement and provides appropriate examples"

      - name: "Question 2. Does the 'Desired Outcome(s)' clearly state achievable goals for the project?"
        extra instructions: |
          Process 1: Review the provided 'Desired Outcomes(s)’ and determine whether it aligns with the issues identified in the 'Problem Summary'.
          Process 2: Check if the outcomes are:
            - **Achievable**: The statement should describe goals that are realistic and feasible within the project's scope, resources, and timeline. It should provide enough context to demonstrate how the outcomes address the identified problem.
          Process 3: Assign a score of 1 if the outcomes:
            - Clearly state achievable goals that address the issues outlined in the 'Problem Summary'
            - Provide sufficient context to explain why the goals are feasible.
          Process 4: Assign a score of 0 if the outcomes:
            - Are overly vague or generic (e.g., "improve outcomes" without explaining how it will be done).
            - Do not specify achievable goals or fail to align with the 'Problem Summary'
          Process 5: Provide a brief explanation for the score.
        example1:
          input: "The Guidance Center’s desired outcome is to screen 85% of our members using the PRAPARE tool, and track services provided of 50% of our member indicative to PRAPARE screening results."
          score: "1"
          explanation:  "The outcome is achievable as it focuses on using an existing tool (PRAPARE) and outlines a clear process (screening and service provision)."
        example2:
          input: "Increase the number of patients screened for HRSN and referred to CBO’s."
          score: "1"
          explanation: "The outcome is realistic and aligns with addressing the HRSN gap."
        example3:
          input: "Ensuring all patients health needs and social determinants are met"
          score: "0"
          explanation: "The outcome is vague and does not explain how it will be achieved or what actions will be taken."

      - name: "Question 3. Does the 'Benefits' state the advantages or improvements the project will deliver?"
        extra instructions: |
          Process 1: If the specific section (Problem Summary, Desired Outcomes, Benefits) appears to be missing or unclear due to formatting issues:
            - Identify the section title (Problem Summary, Desired Outcomes, Benefits) and extract the surrounding text above and below the title.
            - If the surrounding text provides relevant context, use it to evaluate the section.
            - If no relevant content is found in the surrounding text or other sections, explain that the section is missing due to formatting issues.
          Process 2: Evaluate the 'Benefits' section, including:
            - Text directly below the "Benefits:" title.
            - If the "Benefits:" section is missing or empty, evaluate text below "Desired Outcomes" for relevant content.
          Process 3: Evaluate the 'Benefits' using the following criteria:
            - Relevant: Align with the project's goals and address the identified gaps.
            - Feasible: Provide a logical improvement or advantage, even if they are generic.
          Process 4: Assign a score of 1 if the 'Benefits' are relevant, and feasible, even if they are generic.
          Process 5: Assign a score of 0 if the 'Benefits' are generic or fail to align with the project's objectives.
          Process 6: The score should be binary only 0 or 1.
        example1:
          input: "The success of this project will meet the diverse needs of our underserved patients, leading to lower healthcare expenses through improved patient adherence and reduced use of high-cost and otherwise unnecessary services"
          score: "1"
          explanation: "The benefits are specific (lower healthcare expenses, improved adherence) and relevant to the project's goals."
        example2:
          input: "The success of this project will increase our chance for identifying parents and caregivers with PeriPartum depression and/or anxiety at an early stage, allowing for referral of those individuals to our integrated behavioral health, and/or external resources."
          score: "1"
          explanation: "The benefits are specific (early identification and referral) and aligned with improving access to mental health resources."
        example3:
          input: "To ensure patients with positive/negative screens are being recognized by both the practice and the health plans "
          score: "0"
          explanation: "The benefits are vague and do not explain what specific advantages or improvements will result from the project."
