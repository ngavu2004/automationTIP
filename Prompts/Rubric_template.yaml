  instructions: |
    1. Assign a score based on the criteria and provided grade range.
    2. For **each score assigned**, provide a **clear and detailed explanation** that justifies the score, including references to specific aspects of the project report that led to the score.
        - If the score is low, explain what was missing or insufficient.
        - If the score is high, explain what was well-done or exceeded expectations.
        - Focus only on the evaluation of '{part_name}' as a whole.
        - Do not create or refer to any sub-sections under '{part_name}'.
    3. Ensure that **every question** under '{part_name}' is evaluated. Do not skip or omit any questions, even if the response is minimal.
    4. The explanation should focus on **how well the report meets the criteria** outlined for that section.
    5. Ensure the JSON is well-formed, properly indented, and does not contain any syntax errors.
